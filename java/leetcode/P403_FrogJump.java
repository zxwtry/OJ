/**
 * 	A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and
 *  at each unit there may or may not exist a stone. 
 *  The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.
 *	
 *	Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, 
 *	determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last stone.
 *	 Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.
 *	
 *	If the frog has just jumped k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1,
 *	 k, or k + 1 units. Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.
 *	
 *	Note:
 *	
 *	The number of stones is â‰¥ 2 and is < 1,100.
 *	Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 231.
 *	The first stone's position is always 0.
 *	Example 1:
 *	
 *	[0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
 *	
 *	There are a total of 8 stones.
 *	The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone at the 1st unit,
 *	third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on...
 *	The last stone at the 17th unit.
 *	
 *	Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 
 *	1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 
 *	2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 
 *	4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
 *	Example 2:
 *	
 *	[0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
 *	
 *	Return false. There is no way to jump to the last stone as 
 *	the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.
