/**
 * 	The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.
 * 	
 * 	Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.
 * 	
 * 	Example 1:
 * 	     3
 * 	    / \
 * 	   2   3
 * 	    \   \ 
 * 	     3   1
 * 	Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
 * 	Example 2:
 * 	     3
 * 	    / \
 * 	   4   5
 * 	  / \   \ 
 * 	 1   3   1
 * 	Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
