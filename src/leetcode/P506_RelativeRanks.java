/**
 *  Given scores of N athletes, find their relative ranks and the people with 
 *  the top three highest scores, who will be awarded medals: "Gold Medal", 
 *  "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal".
 *  
 *  Example 1:
 *  Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
 *  Output: ["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal", "4", "5"]
 *  Explanation: The first three athletes got the top three highest scores, 
 *  so they got "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal". 
 *  For the left two athletes, you just need to output their relative ranks 
 *  according to their scores.
 *  Note:
 *  N is a positive integer and won't exceed 10,000.
 *  All the scores of athletes are guaranteed to be unique.
