/**
 * 	You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: 
 * 	There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of 
 * 	you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes 
 * 	the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn
 *  to remove the stones.

	Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the
	 game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game
	  given the number of stones in the heap.
	
	For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will
	never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the 
	last stone will always be removed by your friend.
	
	Hint:
	
	If there are 5 stones in the heap, could you figure out a way to 
	remove the stones such that you will always be the winner?
