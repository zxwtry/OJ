/**
 * 	Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes.
 *  Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.

 * 	You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity
 * 	 and O(nodes) time complexity.
 * 	
 * 	Example:
 * 	Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL,
 * 	return 1->3->5->2->4->NULL.
 * 	
 * 	Note:
 * 	The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was 
 * 	in the input. 
 * 	The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...
