/**
 * 	Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.
 *	
 *	For example,
 *	Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
 *	The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4. 
 *	Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for 
 *	you to return the length.
 *	
 *	Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.
 *	
 *	Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
 *	
 *	Credits:
 *	Special thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
