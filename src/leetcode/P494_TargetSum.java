/**
 * 	You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. 
 * 	Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one from + and - 
 * 	as its new symbol.
 *	
 *	Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.
 *	
 *	Example 1:
 *	Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3. 
 *	Output: 5
 *	Explanation: 
 *	
 *	-1+1+1+1+1 = 3
 *	+1-1+1+1+1 = 3
 *	+1+1-1+1+1 = 3
 *	+1+1+1-1+1 = 3
 *	+1+1+1+1-1 = 3
 *	
 *	There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
 *	Note:
 *	The length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 20.
 *	The sum of elements in the given array will not exceed 1000.
 *	Your output answer is guaranteed to be fitted in a 32-bit integer.
