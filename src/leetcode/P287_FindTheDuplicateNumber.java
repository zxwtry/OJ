/**
 * 	Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is 
 * 	between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number
 *  must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the 
 *  duplicate one.
 *	
 *	Note:
 *	You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
 *	You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
 *	Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
 *	There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could 
 *	be repeated more than once.
