/**
 * 	Given an integer array, your task is to find all the different possible increasing subsequences 
 * 	of the given array, and the length of an increasing subsequence should be at least 2 .
 *	
 *	Example:
 *	Input: [4, 6, 7, 7]
 *	Output: [[4, 6], [4, 7], [4, 6, 7], [4, 6, 7, 7], [6, 7], [6, 7, 7], [7,7], [4,7,7]]
 *	Note:
 *	The length of the given array will not exceed 15.
 *	The range of integer in the given array is [-100,100].
 *	The given array may contain duplicates, and two equal integers should also be considered as a 
 *	special case of increasing sequence.
