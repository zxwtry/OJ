/**
 * 	Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer)
 *  of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

	According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has
	index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and
	the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."
	
	For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher 
	has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations 
	respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations 
	each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
	
	Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is 
	taken as the h-index.
	
	Hint:
	
	An easy approach is to sort the array first.
	What are the possible values of h-index?
	A faster approach is to use extra space.
