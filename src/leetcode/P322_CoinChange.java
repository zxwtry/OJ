/**
 * 	You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. 
 * 	Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount.
 *  If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
	
	Example 1:
	coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
	return 3 (11 = 5 + 5 + 1)
	
	Example 2:
	coins = [2], amount = 3
	return -1.
	
	Note:
	You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin
