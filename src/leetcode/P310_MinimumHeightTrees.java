/**
 * 	For a undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any 
 *  node as the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all 
 *  possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum 
 *  height trees (MHTs). Given such a graph, write a function to find 
 *  all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.
 *
 *	Format
 *	The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0 to n - 1. 
 *	You will be given the number n and a list of undirected edges 
 *	(each edge is a pair of labels).
 *	
 *	You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. 
 *	Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] 
 *	and thus will not appear together in edges.
 *	
 *	Example 1:
 *	
 *	Given n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]
 *	
 *	        0
 *	        |
 *	        1
 *	       / \
 *	      2   3
 *	return [1]
 *	
 *	Example 2:
 *	
 *	Given n = 6, edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]
 *	
 *	     0  1  2
 *	      \ | /
 *	        3
 *	        |
 *	        4
 *	        |
 *	        5
 *	return [3, 4]
 *	
 *	Hint:
 *	
 *	How many MHTs can a graph have at most?
 *	Note:
 *	
 *	(1) According to the definition of tree on Wikipedia: “a tree 
 *	is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected 
 *	by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without 
 *	simple cycles is a tree.”
 *	
 *	(2) The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the 
 *	longest downward path between the root and a leaf.
