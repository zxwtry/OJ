/**
 * 	You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: 
 * 	You write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. 
 * 	Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates 
 * 	how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit 
 * 	and position (called "bulls") and how many digits match the secret number 
 * 	but locate in the wrong position (called "cows"). Your friend will use 
 * 	successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.

	For example:
	
	Secret number:  "1807"
	Friend's guess: "7810"
	Hint: 1 bull and 3 cows. (The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.)
	Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and 
	friend's guess, use A to indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows. 
	In the above example, your function should return "1A3B".
	
	Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits, 
	for example:
	
	Secret number:  "1123"
	Friend's guess: "0111"
	In this case, the 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow, 
	and your function should return "1A1B".
	You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits, 
	and their lengths are always equal.
