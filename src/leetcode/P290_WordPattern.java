/**
 * 	Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

	Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between 
	a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.
	
	Examples:
	pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return true.
	pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish" should return false.
	pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return false.
	pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog" should return false.
	Notes:
	You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str 
	contains lowercase letters separated by a single space
