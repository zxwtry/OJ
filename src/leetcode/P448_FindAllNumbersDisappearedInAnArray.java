/**
 *  Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), 
 *  some elements appear twice and others appear once.
 *  
 *  Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
 *  
 *  Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? 
 *  You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
 *  
 *  Example:
 *  
 *  Input:
 *  [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
 *  
 *  Output:
 *  [5,6]
