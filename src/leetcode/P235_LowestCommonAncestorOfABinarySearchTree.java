/**
 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) 
 * of two given nodes in the BST.

	According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor
	 is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v
	  and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

	       /              \
	    ___2__          ___8__
	   /      \        /      \
	   0      _4       7       9
	         /  \
	         3   5
	For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
	 Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant
	  of itself according to the LCA definition.
