/**
 * 	Given a positive integer, output its complement number. 
 * 	The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

	Note:
	The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
	You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.
	Example 1:
	Input: 5
	Output: 2
	Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
	Example 2:
	Input: 1
	Output: 0
	Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to out
