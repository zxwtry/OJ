/*
 * 	Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list,
 *  find the length of shortest transformation sequence
 *   from beginWord to endWord, such that:

	Only one letter can be changed at a time
	Each intermediate word must exist in the word list
	For example,
	
	Given:
	beginWord = "hit"
	endWord = "cog"
	wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
	As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
	return its length 5.
	
	Note:
	Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
	All words have the same length.
	All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
