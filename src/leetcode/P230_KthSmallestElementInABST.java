/*
 * 	Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth 
 * smallest element in it.

	Note: 
	You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
	
	Follow up:
	What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you 
	need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize 
	the kthSmallest routine?
	
	Hint:
	
	Try to utilize the property of a BST.
	What if you could modify the BST node's structure?
	The optimal runtime complexity is O(height of BST).
	Credits:
	Special thanks to @ts for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
