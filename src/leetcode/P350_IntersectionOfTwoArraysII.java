/**
 * 	Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
 * 	
 *	Example:
 *	Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2, 2].
 *	
 *	Note:
 *	Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
 *	The result can be in any order.
 *	Follow up:
 *	What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
 *	What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
 *	What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
