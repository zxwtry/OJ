/**
 *  Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of 
 *  integer, say (a1, b2), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i 
 *  from 1 to n as large as possible.

    Example 1:
    Input: [1,4,3,2]
    
    Output: 4
    Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4.
    Note:
    n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
    All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].
