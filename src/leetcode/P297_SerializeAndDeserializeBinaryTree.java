/**
 * 	Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into
 *  a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or
 *  transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in
 *  the same or another computer environment.
 *  Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no
 *   restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
 *  You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and
 *   this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
 *  
 *  For example, you may serialize the following tree
 *  
 *      1
 *     / \
 *    2   3
 *       / \
 *      4   5
 *  as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]", just the same as how LeetCode OJ serializes
 *   a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so 
 *   please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
 *  Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states.
 *   Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
